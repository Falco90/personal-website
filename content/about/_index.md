Growing up in a small village in the Netherlands in the 90’s and 00’s, I was fascinated by the rise of consumer technology and the world wide web. As a child it started for me with playing games on the Nintendo Gameboy and on the PC with my sister. It was a magical experience that sparked my interest in technology at a young age.

After gaming through my high school years I went to study Psychology at the University of Groningen. The human mind is a topic that still deeply interests me, and Psychology is a field that I would like to return to at some point later in life.

A few years after graduating university I took my first few steps into software development by joining a local coding bootcamp, and I have been programming ever since. First at IBM as a junior, and later as a freelancer in the blockchain field. Nowadays I see myself as a freelance full-stack developer, with a special interest in education and public goods.

I am currently based in The Netherlands and in Thailand, where I live together with my wife. In my free time I like to read books, travel, and meditate. I am a volunteer at the Shambhala meditation center in Bangkok.
